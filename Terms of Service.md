# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Metropolis Nexus, a suite of services provided by Thien (Tommy) Tran and affiliated contributors (collectively, "we," "us," "our") as a free hobby project (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

Metropolis Nexus is offered on an "as-is" basis. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services at any time. You are solely responsible for backing up your data.

## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use the Services. You also represent you are not on any denied‑party, sanctions, or similar government list. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

## 2. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws, including those of the United States and your local jurisdiction. Prohibited conducts include, but are not limited to:

- Engaging in illegal activities, such as doxxing, scamming, cyberbullying, or making direct threats of violence.
- Engaging in spamming, unsolicited bulk messaging, or persistent harassment, including continuing unwanted personal, romantic, or sexual advances after receiving explicit notice to cease.
- Attempting to compromise another user's personal systems by transmitting malware, exploits, or IP grabber links without their explicit prior consent and knowledge. Sharing malware samples for legitimate security research with clear, explicit warnings about their malicious nature is permitted.
- Harassing, discriminating against, or shaming individuals based on their personal preferences, characteristics beyond their control, or private lifestyles, including but not limited to slut-shaming, kink-shaming, or discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.
- Engaging in defamatory conduct, including knowingly making false, malicious, or libelous accusations against others with intent to harm their reputation, such as unsubstantiated claims of racism, bigotry, anti-Semitism, or similar serious misconduct.
- Using the Services primarily for pornographic content distribution. This restriction implements compliance with state laws requiring age verification when such content exceeds one-third of platform material. While we cannot measure your exact usage ratio in real-time, we reserve the right to determine, at our sole discretion based on reported content and usage patterns, when this threshold is likely exceeded, and to suspend accounts we reasonably believe violate this standard.
- Distributing any sexual content involving real minors or child sexual abuse material (CSAM). We report apparent CSAM to NCMEC and applicable authorities as required by law. Do not upload, request, or link to CSAM.
- Distributing sexual material involving fictional underage characters (i.e., "loli" content). Although this may be permissible under U.S. law, it is prohibited in numerous other jurisdictions where the Services may potentially be hosted in the future.
- Engaging in activities that may attract undue regulatory or governmental scrutiny, including organizing protests or demonstrations, or expressing wishes of bodily harm toward public figures (even if hyperbolic). We reserve the right to determine, at our sole discretion, which activity violates this policy.
- Advocating for digital ID systems, pornography bans, age verification requirements, chat control legislation, or other government intrusions into private life.
- Intentionally overburdening or abusing the Services' resources, including but not limited to scraping content without prior consent, using messaging platforms for excessive file storage, or initiating communications such as video calls solely to consume bandwidth without a legitimate purpose.
- Conducting cyber attacks against the Services. Limited penetration testing against your own accounts for the purpose of reporting vulnerabilities to us is permitted. However, network stress testing, denial‑of‑service activities, and attempting to gain access to other user accounts are prohibited.
- Any other conduct that we determine, in our sole discretion, is harmful to the Services, users, or third parties.

We reserve the right to monitor usage and take action, including suspension or termination of access, if we believe these Terms have been violated.

To report vulnerabilities or violations of these Terms, contact us via Matrix at @tommy:metropolis.nexus or by email at tommy@metropolis.nexus. We will investigate reports but make no guarantee of response time or action taken.

## 3. Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account. Use strong, unique passwords and enable any available two-factor authentication. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access. We are not liable for losses caused by unauthorized access resulting from your failure to secure your account.


## 4. Intellectual Property

**Your Content**: We do not claim ownership of any intellectual property rights in messages, files, or other content you upload or transmit through the Services ("Your Content"). Solely to operate and improve the Services, you grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free, sublicensable license to host, store, reproduce, transmit, display, and create non‑material adaptations of Your Content (e.g., transcoding, resizing, indexing). This license ends when Your Content is deleted from our systems, except for reasonable backup copies and logs that will be purged in the ordinary course.

**Your Responsibility**: By uploading or transmitting Your Content, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all necessary intellectual property rights and other rights to Your Content, and that Your Content does not infringe upon any third-party rights. You are solely and entirely responsible for all Your Content that you post.

**Liability for Sharing**: We are not liable if you grant another user access to Your Content and that user subsequently violates these Terms or infringes upon your rights. You are responsible for controlling access to Your Content through appropriate privacy settings and access controls.

**Copyright; DMCA**: If you believe content infringes your copyright, send a notice to tommy@metropolis.nexus with the information required by §512(c)(3). We may remove or disable access to the alleged infringing material and, where appropriate, terminate repeat infringers. If your content was removed in error, you may submit a counter‑notification per §512(g). We are not obligated to monitor for infringements but may do so.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or uninterrupted or error-free operation. We do not warrant that the Services will meet your requirements or that any defects will be corrected.

## 6. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Metropolis Nexus shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Services, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Except where prohibited by law, our total liability to you shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Services (which is zero, as they are provided free of charge).

## 7. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Metropolis Nexus from any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Services, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

## 8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Arizona, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Services shall be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Arizona.

Our servers are currently hosted in Arizona, Illinois, and New York. Our hosting providers are based in California, Illinois, and the Netherlands. You agree that any conduct illegal under the laws of any of these jurisdictions is prohibited on the Services, regardless of your physical location.

## 9. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Terms on the Services or through other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Services after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 10. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to the Services or remove content at any time, with or without notice, if we reasonably believe it is necessary to protect the Services or other users, to comply with law, or for any reason. Where feasible, we will provide a brief notice. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends immediately. Sections intended to survive (including §§4–9, 11) shall survive termination.

## 11. Miscellaneous
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Metropolis Nexus regarding the Services. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision shall not constitute a waiver.

If you have questions about these Terms, please contact us via Matrix at @tommy:metropolis.nexus or by email at tommy@metropolis.nexus.

By using Metropolis Nexus, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms.
