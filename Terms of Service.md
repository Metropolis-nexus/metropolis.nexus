# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Metropolis Nexus, a suite of services provided by Thien (Tommy) Tran and affiliated contributors (collectively, "we," "us," "our") as a free hobby project (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

Metropolis Nexus is offered on an "as-is" basis. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services at any time. You are solely responsible for backing up your data.

## 1. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

## 2. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable laws, including those of the United States and your local jurisdiction. Prohibited conducts include, but are not limited to:

- Engaging in illegal activities, such as doxxing, scamming, cyberbullying, or making direct threats of violence.
- Engaging in spamming, unsolicited bulk messaging, or persistent harassment, including continuing unwanted personal, romantic, or sexual advances after receiving explicit notice to cease.
- Attempting to compromise another user's personal systems by transmitting malware, exploits, or IP grabber links without their explicit prior consent and knowledge. Sharing malware samples for legitimate security research with clear, explicit warnings about their malicious nature is permitted.
- Harassing, discriminating against, or shaming individuals based on their personal preferences, characteristics beyond their control, or private lifestyles, including but not limited to slut-shaming, kink-shaming, or discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.
- Engaging in defamatory conduct, including knowingly making false, malicious, or libelous accusations against others with intent to harm their reputation, such as unsubstantiated claims of racism, bigotry, anti-Semitism, or similar serious misconduct.
- Using the Services primarily for pornographic content distribution. This restriction implements compliance with state laws requiring age verification when such content exceeds one-third of platform material. While we cannot measure your exact usage ratio in real-time, we reserve the right to determine, at our sole discretion based on reported content and usage patterns, when this threshold is likely exceeded, and to suspend accounts we reasonably believe violate this standard.
- Distributing sexual material involving fictional underage characters (i.e., "loli" content). Although this may be permissible under U.S. law, it is prohibited in numerous other jurisdictions where the Services may potentially be hosted in the future.
- Engaging in activities likely to result in DMCA takedown requests.
- Engaging in activities that may attract undue regulatory or governmental scrutiny, including organizing protests or demonstrations, or expressing wishes of bodily harm toward public figures (even if hyperbolic).
- Advocating for digital ID systems, pornography bans, age verification requirements, chat control legislation, or other government intrusions into private life.
- Intentionally overburdening or abusing the Services' resources, including but not limited to scraping content without prior consent, using messaging platforms for excessive file storage, or initiating communications such as video calls solely to consume bandwidth without a legitimate purpose.
- Conducting DDoS attacks on the Services. Penetration testing for the purpose of reporting vulnerabilities to us is permitted, but network stress testing is not.

We reserve the right to monitor usage and take action, including suspension or termination of access, if we believe these Terms have been violated.

To report violations of these Terms, contact us via Matrix at @tommy:metropolis.nexus or by email at tommy@metropolis.nexus. We will investigate reports but make no guarantee of response time or action taken.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account. Use strong, unique passwords and enable any available two-factor authentication. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access. We are not liable for losses caused by unauthorized access resulting from your failure to secure your account.


## 4. Intellectual Property

**Liability for Sharing**: We are not liable if you grant another user access to Your Content and that user subsequently violates these Terms or infringes upon your rights. You are responsible for controlling access to Your Content through appropriate privacy settings and access controls.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or uninterrupted or error-free operation. We do not warrant that the Services will meet your requirements or that any defects will be corrected.

## 6. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Metropolis Nexus shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Services, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 7. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Metropolis Nexus from any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Services, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

## 8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Illinois, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Services shall be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Illinois.

Our servers are currently hosted in Illinois, New York, and Arizona. One of our hosting provider is based the Netherlands. You agree that any conduct illegal under the laws of any of these jurisdictions is prohibited on the Services, regardless of your physical location.

## 9. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Terms on the Services or through other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Services after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 10. Termination
We may suspend your access to the Services only for cause, unless due to circumstances beyond our control. We will give you a termination notice if the circumstances is within our control. Upon termination or suspension, your right to use the Services will immediately cease.

## 11. Miscellaneous
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Metropolis Nexus regarding the Services. If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision shall not constitute a waiver.
